### Step 4 – Lobby (Camera Preview)

Before joining the meeting, you'll enter the lobby where you can:

1. **Allow camera & mic** - Grant permissions for video and audio
2. **Check your preview** - See how you look before joining
3. **Enter your name** - Set your display name for the meeting
4. **Click CONNECT** - Join the video call when ready

This ensures you're fully prepared before entering the meeting room.

- **Toggle visibility** - Show or hide the chat panel as needed

Messages appear in a modern bubble design with sender names clearly displayed.
